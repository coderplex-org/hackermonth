          Hacker Month is a series of four meetups that revolve around the idea of learning to code by building. On the first day, you'll pitch your idea for a project to everyone, and those who find it interesting will join your team, or pitch their own ideas. Once the teams are formed, they'll spend the next 3 weeks simultaniously learning how to build and actually trying to build their project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is not to actually build the project, but to use it as an opportunity to learn how to build real projects by collaborating with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this meetup, you'll be pitching your ideas and forming teams, then start planning with them on how to build your project. Your goal is to figure out what it will take to build your idea and how to learn it. You'll create your own curriculum for the next 3 weeks, and we'll help you do it.
